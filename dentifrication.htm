      About the exhibition:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Neu-Hohenschönhausen foundation stone has been posed 30 years ago, in 1984. 30 years later the district has planned many events to celebrate this anniversary, and has asked other spaces to organize activities around this subject.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      > We are working in our ateliers only since the beginning of 2014 and are going to leave it for the beginning of 2015 in order to give space for the renovation of the Plattenbauten and shops on our street, which will bring to an increase of the rent for people living or working here. The authorities are waiting for a new wave of inhabitants that are going to leave the more expansive centre of Berlin in order to find cheaper flats here. If this greedy approach could work for the flats, there's almost no chance that this would work also for the shops and commercial activities, which are already vanishing under the presence of one huge shopping mall (and one more will open in the near future).
      > We decided therefore to use these temporal limitations and play with them, as if we would have always been here, since the first moment Neu-Hohenschönhausen, and in particular our area, the so called "Ostsee-Viertel" was grounded.
      > 
      > We have been dealing from the beginning with the "problem" of our distance from the centre of Berlin, and our name JWD (janz weit draussen, the berliner acronym for something very far outside, both in positive and negative meaning) mirrors it. JWD is not only our studio and exhibition space, but the whole area of Hohenschönhausen, according to the point of view of the center of the city. A area which can assume also exoticized features, related to both the history of the DDR or to some more idealistic vision about leaving the city center as a way of leaving the current corrupted society, joining another kind of society, where anyway other forms of corruption exist, some times old-fashioned, other times just unusual or less visible in the center.
      > We have chosen to use one of the first emblem of the district as the first picture to present the exhibition, with two kids depicted in the act of planting a tree surrounded by Plattenbauten. A debatable utopic vision related to the last afflatus of the DDR: the transformation of sewage field on the outskirts of Berlin in an area for the development of new housing estates, that took place from the 1970s on in Marzahn and ended up right in Neu-Hohenschönhausen.
      > 
      > On these basis we are inviting artists to take part in the exhibition and to approach in their way the official and unofficial history, the landscape, the architecture, the social and economic problems of Hohenschönhausen and its more positive features, concurring to create a parallel, manifold, and also playful narration for this area. A documentation of the activities conducted by jwd from 1984 to 2014, before saying farewell to our space in Zingster Strasse 10.
